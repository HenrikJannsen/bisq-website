This proposal increases the maximum BSQ issuance parameter.

A couple cycles of a lower BSQ price with relatively higher amounts of delivered work led to issuances that were approaching the 200,000 BSQ limit. This proposal changed the maximum BSQ issuance to 300,000 BSQ. It was critical that this parameter was changed, because in the event the limit was hit, all compensation requests would be denied.

It is important to note that this parameter was not originally put in place to curb inflationâ€”rather, it was meant as a security measure to limit damage in case of an extreme scenario.

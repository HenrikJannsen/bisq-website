This proposal established a per-case compensation rate for arbitrators (50 USD), as well as a 1% interest rate on BTC paid out in a cycle.

The arbitrator role is a risky, capital-intensive one, and these standards seek to better align the rewards with the risk. At the same time, these arbitration expenses can add up to a considerable sum, so they also act as an incentive for the DAO to reduce arbitration cases.

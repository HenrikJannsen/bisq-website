This proposal approved the migration of the Bisq markets API from the `bisq.network` domain to a new `bisq.markets` domain to improve decentralization of the ownership of key Bisq domain names. 

This development sparked the start of [a new project](https://github.com/bisq-network/projects/issues/41) to revamp the markets website as a dashboard for market activity and DAO reporting.
